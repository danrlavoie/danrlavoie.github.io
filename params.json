To support a civically-engaged, cordial America, these reforms would be vital improvements to the way we choose who runs our government.\r\n### Voter registration\r\n* There is no real reason to prevent an American citizen being automatically registered to vote on the day they turn 18. The process of registering to vote just creates a barrier preventing disadvantaged people from engaging in the government.\r\n* When a citizen is automatically registered to vote, they should receive a packet (in mail and/or online) with a pocket constitution, a \"welcome to voting\" letter, a form that can be mailed to register for a political party, and a few change of address forms which would allow the citizen to vote in a new home. All of this information should be available online as well, accessible by linking to the Social Security number.\r\n### Ballot rules\r\n* Ranked choice voting. Every voter ranks as many candidates as they wish from top to bottom. If a person has more than half of the \"first choice\" votes, they win. Otherwise, eliminate the least-preferred candidates and distribute the second choice votes from those ballots. Continue until someone has a majority of votes. This gives third parties a better shot at respectability, and it encourages candidates to create broad appeal to multiple voters instead of strengthening a partisan core.\r\n### District rules\r\n\r\n### Campaign rules\r\n* A candidate for US President must publicly take a civics exam (the same exam used for US citizenship). While the Naturalization test only asks 10 questions from a list of 100, the presidential test uses the full list of 100 questions. A candidate may not appear on the ballot for a party unless they correctly answer 65 or more questions. If they fail the exam, they may take it again for the next election. This discourages uninformed rabble-rousers who couldn't name a Supreme Court Justice from seeking nomination, but makes it possible for any engaged citizen to remain eligible, as well as publicly demonstrates for the nation which candidates are seriously informed about the government.\r\n* Limit campaigning (fundraising, Super PAC coordination, advertisement) to only ten weeks before the primary. There's no reason for a candidate to begin campaigning two full years ahead of an election. Especially given that the House of Representatives only has two-year terms, this essentially turns marquee seats into endless campaigns instead of government jobs.\r\n* Require all candidates on the ballot to distribute a common, templated list of policy positions, available online and in the mail. This gives every citizen access to \"the issues\" for each candidate.\r\n* Constitutional Amendment to neuter Citizens United. Private shadow organizations should not be allowed to channel funds to political candidates.\r\n## \r\n",
